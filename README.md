# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to understand successful campaigns, particularly in theater
As far as categories go, the theater category was quite successful, with 525 successful campaigns of 912 ![Parent Category Outcomes](C:\Users\subom\OneDrive\Desktop\Career\Entrepreneurship\Data Analytics Bootcamp\Class Folder (Analysis Projects)\Crowdfunding Analysis\Parent Category Outcomes.png)
Similarly, it seems like May was the most successful month to launch campaigns ![Outcome Based On Launch Date](C:\Users\subom\OneDrive\Desktop\Career\Entrepreneurship\Data Analytics Bootcamp\Class Folder (Analysis Projects)\Crowdfunding Analysis\Outcome Based on Launch Date.png)
I'd recommend based on this that Louise launch a Theater campaign in May
